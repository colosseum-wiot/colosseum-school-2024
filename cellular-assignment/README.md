# Cellular Assignment

In this assignment, we will use OpenAirInterface (www.openairinterface.org) to instantiate a softwarized cellular network on Colosseum and exchange traffic between the base station and the user(s).

The tutorial is hosted here https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/trainings/oai-workshops/-/tree/main/colosseum

The goal of the assignment is to run an experiment with the OAI core, the OAI gNB and the OAI UE and to collect a wireshark trace of a successfull connection procedure (NGAP protocol).
